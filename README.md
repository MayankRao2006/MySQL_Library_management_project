# Library Management System (SQL Project) ðŸ“š

A beginner-friendly SQL project simulating a **library management system**, where users can manage books, members, and borrowings. The project covers **database creation, table design, data insertion, and basic SQL queries**.

# Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to design and work with relational databases using MySQL. The system consists of three main tables:

1. **Books** â€“ Stores details about books in the library.  
2. **Members** â€“ Stores information about library members.  
3. **Borrowings** â€“ Tracks which member borrowed which book and when.
